# NLPtest

**NLPtest** is Python package designed to ease behavioral testing of natural language processing models.

# Documentation

**NLPtest** provides helper objects for three different aspects: easily generate text samples, test some specific
behaviors of your model and aggregate the test outcomes of your model.

To help you get the hang of the library we provide three different Notebooks, accessible from the `examples/` folder:

1. `Samples_generation.ipynb`: shows you how to easily generate texts using the `Generator` object.
2. `Please_Behave.ipynb`: getting familiar with the `Behavior` object.
3. `End2End_tests.ipynb`: how to run tests and get an overview of your model behavior.
